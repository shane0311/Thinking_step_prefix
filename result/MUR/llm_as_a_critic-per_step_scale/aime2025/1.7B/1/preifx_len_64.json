                "completed_step": "Determine the number of eight-digit numbers divisible by 22.\n\nFor a numberto be divisible by 2, the last digit must be even. The even digits among 1 through 8 are: 2, 4, 6, 8. So there are 4 choices for the last digit.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 11, the alternating sum of its digits must be a multiple of 11. Let\u2019s denote the digits as $d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, d_6, d_7, d_8$, where $d_8$ is the last digit.\n\nThe alternating sum is $d_1 - d_2 + d_3 - d_4 + d_5 - d_6 + d_7 - d_8$.\n\nThis must be a multiple of 11. Since the digits are from 1 through 8, the total sum of digits is $1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 36$. The alternating sum can be written as:\n\n$$\n(d_1 + d_3 + d_5 + d_7) - (d_2 + d_4 + d_6 + d_8)\n$$\n\nLet $S = d_1 + d_3 + d_5 + d_7$ and $T = d_2 + d_4 + d_6 + d_8$. Then $S - T$ must be divisible by 11.\n\nAlso, since $S + T = 36$, we have:\n\n$$\nS - T = 36 - 2T\n$$\n\nSo $36 - 2T$ must be divisible by 11. That is:\n\n$$\n36 - 2T \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11} \\Rightarrow 2T \\equiv 36 \\pmod{11}\n$$\n\n$$\n36 \\mod 11 = 3 \\Rightarrow 2T \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}\n$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 2 modulo 11. Since $2 \\cdot 6 = 12 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, the inverse of 2 modulo 11 is 6.\n\n$$\nT \\equiv 3 \\cdot 6 \\equiv 18 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11}\n$$\n\nSo $T \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11}$. Therefore, $T = 7$ or $T = 18$ (since $T$ is the sum of 4 digits, and the minimum possible sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10, and the maximum is 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 26).\n\nSo $T = 7$ or $T = 18$.\n\nNow, since $T = d_2 + d_4 + d_6 + d_8$, and $d_8$ must be even (to make the number divisible by 2), we can analyze the possible values of $T$.\n\nLet\u2019s count the number of valid combinations for each case.\n\n---\n\n###"

Then the point $B$ is at $(0, 6)$, and the diameter $\\overline{BC}$ is along the y-axis.\n\nThen point $C$ is at $(0, 6 + 15) = (0, 21)$, and the center of $\\omega_2$ is at $(21, 0)$.\n\nNow, $\\overline{BC}$ is vertical, so $\\overline{AD}$ is horizontal, meaning $D$ is horizontally aligned with $A = (0, 0)$, so $D = (x, 0)$.\n\nSince $D$ lies on $\\omega_2$, its distance from $(21, 0)$ is 15:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{(x - 21)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = 15 \\Rightarrow |x - 21| = 15 \\Rightarrow x = 21 \\pm 15\n$$\n\nSo $x = 36$ or $x = 6$.
