The actual solution will involve analyzing the geometry of the triangle and the given points, using coordinate geometry or vector methods to find coordinates of points, and then calculating areas.\n\nLet's proceed with the solution.\n\nWe are given a triangle $ \\triangle ABC $, with points $ A, D, E, B $ on side $ \\overline{AB} $ in that order, and points $ A, F, G, C $ on side $ \\overline{AC} $ in that order. The distances are:\n\n- $ AD = 4 $\n- $ DE = 16 $\n- $ EB = 8 $\n- $ AF = 13 $\n- $ FG = 52 $\n- $ GC = 26 $\n\nLet\u2019s define coordinates to simplify the problem. Let\u2019s place point $ A $ at the origin $ (0, 0) $, and point $ B $ at $ (24, 0) $, since $ AD + DE + EB = 4 + 16 + 8 = 28 $, so $ AB = 28 $.\n\nSimilarly, we place point $ C $ at $ (0, h) $ for some height $ h $, so that $ AC $ is vertical. Then, point $ F $ is 13 units from $ A $, so its coordinates are $ (13, 0) $, and point $ G $ is 13 + 52 = 65 units from $ A $, so its coordinates are $ (65, 0) $.\n\nNow, we are given that the area of quadrilateral $ DEGF $ is 288. We need to find the area of the heptagon $ AFNBCEM $.\n\nLet\u2019s first find the coordinates of points $ D, E, G, F $:\n\n- $ D $ is 4 units from $ A $, so its coordinates are $ (4, 0) $\n- $ E $ is 4 + 16 = 20 units from $ A $, so its coordinates are $ (20, 0) $\n- $ F $ is 13 units from $ A $, so its coordinates are $ (13, 0) $\n- $ G $ is 65 units from $ A $, so its coordinates are $ (65, 0) $\n\nNext, we need to find the area of quadrilateral $ DEGF $, which is formed by the points $ D(4, 0), E(20, 0), G(65, 0), F(13, 0) $.\n\nWe can use the shoelace formula for the area of a quadrilateral:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_4 + x_4y_1 - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + y_3x_4 + y_4x_1)|\n$$\n\nSubstituting the coordinates:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |4 \\cdot 0 + 20 \\cdot 0 + 65 \\cdot 0 + 13 \\cdot 0 - (0 \\cdot 20 + 0 \\cdot 65 + 0 \\cdot 13 + 0 \\cdot 4)| = 0\n$$\n\nThis result is not correct, as the area should be 288. Therefore, the assumption that $ D, E, G, F $ are all on the same line (horizontal) is incorrect. Instead, we must assume that the points $ D, E, G, F $ are not on the same line, and the quadrilateral $ DEGF $ is non-degenerate.\n\nSo, we need to place the points $ D, E, G, F $ in the triangle $ ABC $ such that the area of quadrilateral $ DEGF $ is 288.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the triangle $ ABC $ has base $ AB = 28 $ and height $ h $, so the area of triangle $ ABC $ is $ \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 28 \\cdot h = 14h $.\n\nNow, we can place the points $ D, E, G, F $ such that they lie on the base $ AB $, and the quadrilateral $ DEGF $ has area 288.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that $ D, E, G, F $ are on the base $ AB $, and the height of the triangle is $ h $. Then, the area of quadrilateral $ DEGF $ is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (AD + DE + EG + GF) \\cdot h\n$$\n\nBut this is not a standard formula. Instead, we need to consider the coordinates of $ D, E, G, F $, and use the shoelace formula.\n\nLet\u2019s define the coordinates of $ D, E, G, F $ as follows:\n\n- $ D = (4, 0) $\n- $ E = (20, 0) $\n- $ G = (65, 0) $\n- $ F = (13, 0) $\n\nNow, we can calculate the area of quadrilateral $ DEGF $ using the shoelace formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |4 \\cdot 0 + 20 \\cdot 0 + 65 \\cdot 0 + 13 \\cdot 0 - (0 \\cdot 20 + 0 \\cdot 65 + 0 \\cdot 13 + 0 \\cdot 4)| = 0\n$$\n\nAgain, this is not correct. Therefore, the assumption that $ D, E, G, F $ are on the same line is incorrect.\n\nInstead, we must assume that the points $ D, E, G, F $ are not on the same line, and the quadrilateral $ DEGF $ is non-degenerate.\n\nSo, we need to place the points $ D, E, G, F $ in the triangle $ ABC $ such that the area of quadrilateral $ DEGF $ is 288.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the triangle $ ABC $ has base $ AB = 28 $ and height $ h $, so the area of triangle $ ABC $ is $ 14h $.\n\nLet\u2019s now consider the coordinates of points $ D, E, G, F $ in the triangle $ ABC $, and use the shoelace formula to calculate the area of quadrilateral $ DEGF $.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the coordinates of $ D, E, G, F $ are $ (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3), (x_4, y_4) $, and the area of quadrilateral $ DEGF $ is 288.\n\nUsing the shoelace formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_4 + x_4y_1 - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + y_3x_4 + y_4x_1)|\n$$\n\nSubstituting the coordinates:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_4 + x_4y_1 - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + y_3x_4 + y_4x_1)|\n$$\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the points are placed such that the area of quadrilateral $ DEGF $ is 288.\n\nLet\u2019s now calculate the area of the heptagon $ AFNBCEM $, which consists of the following regions:\n\n- Triangle $ AFN $\n- Trapezoid $ NBEA $\n- Triangle $ EGC $\n- Triangle $ CEM $\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the area of each region:\n\n1.

We are to find the number of such numbers divisible by 22 and then compute the difference between this number and 2025.\n\nTo be divisible by 22, a number must be divisible by both 2 and 11.\n\n1. **Divisibility by 2:** A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. Among the digits 1 through 8, the even digits are 2, 4, 6, and 8. Thus, the last digit can be any of these four digits.\n\n2. **Divisibility by 11:** A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is a multiple of 11 (including zero).\n\nLet\u2019s denote the digits of the number as $d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, d_6, d_7, d_8$ in the positions 1 through 8. The sum of the digits is fixed as $S = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36$.\n\nFor divisibility by 11, we need:\n$$\n(d_1 + d_3 + d_5 + d_7) - (d_2 + d_4 + d_6 + d_8) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}\n$$\n\nLet\u2019s denote $A = d_1 + d_3 + d_5 + d_7$ and $B = d_2 + d_4 + d_6 + d_8$. Then:\n$$\nA - B \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11} \\Rightarrow A \\equiv B \\pmod{11}\n$$\n\nSince $A + B = 36$, we can solve for $A$ and $B$ such that:\n$$\nA \\equiv B \\pmod{11} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad A + B = 36\n$$\n\nLet\u2019s solve this system of equations.\n\nFrom $A + B = 36$ and $A \\equiv B \\pmod{11}$, we get:\n$$\nA \\equiv 36 - A \\pmod{11} \\Rightarrow 2A \\equiv 36 \\pmod{11}\n$$\n\nSimplify:\n$$\n2A \\equiv 36 \\pmod{11} \\Rightarrow 2A \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}\n$$\n\nMultiply both sides by the modular inverse of 2 modulo 11. The inverse of 2 modulo 11 is 6, since $2 \\cdot 6 = 12 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\n\nSo:\n$$\nA \\equiv 3 \\cdot 6 \\pmod{11} \\Rightarrow A \\equiv 18 \\pmod{11} \\Rightarrow A \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11}\n$$\n\nThus, $A \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11}$, and since $A + B = 36$, we have:\n$$\nA = 7 + 11k, \\quad B = 36 - A = 36 - (7 + 11k) = 29 - 11k\n$$\n\nWe need $A$ and $B$ to be valid sums of 4 digits from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, and both $A$ and $B$ must be between 10 and 36 (since the minimum sum of 4 digits is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10, and the maximum is 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 26).\n\nLet\u2019s try possible values of $k$ such that $A$ and $B$ are valid:\n\n- $k = 0$: $A = 7$, $B = 29$ \u2192 Invalid (7 < 10)\n- $k = 1$: $A = 18$, $B = 29 - 11 = 18$ \u2192 Valid\n- $k = 2$: $A = 29$, $B = 29 - 22 = 7$ \u2192 Invalid (7 < 10)\n- $k = 3$: $A = 40$, $B = 29 - 33 = -4$ \u2192 Invalid\n\nSo the only valid case is $k = 1$, where $A = 18$ and $B = 18$.\n\nThus, the sum of the digits in the odd positions must be 18, and the sum of the digits in the even positions must also be 18.\n\nWe now count how many such permutations exist where the sum of the digits in the odd positions is 18.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorics problem. We need to choose 4 digits from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} that sum to 18.\n\nWe can list all such combinations and count the number of permutations for each.\n\n###"

We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the non-parallel sides.\n\nLet the length of each non-parallel side be $a$. The height is 6, and the difference in the lengths of the parallel sides is $r - s$. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the non-parallel sides are equal, and the difference in the lengths of the parallel sides is split evenly on both sides. So:\n$$\n\\text{Difference in parallel sides} = r - s\n$$\nThis difference is split into two equal parts, each of length $\\frac{r - s}{2}$. Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n$$\na^2 = \\left(\\frac{r - s}{2}\\right)^2 + 6^2\n$$\n$$\na^2 = \\left(\\frac{r - s}{2}\\right)^2 + 36\n$$\nWe also know that $r + s = 24$.

From the equation for $a^2$:\n$$\na^2 = \\left(\\frac{r - s}{2}\\right)^2 + 36\n$$\n$$\na^2 = \\frac{(r - s)^2}{4} + 36\n$$\nBut since $r + s = 24$, we can express $r - s$ in terms of $r$ and $s$. Let's denote $r - s = x$. Then:\n$$\nx = r - s\n$$\nFrom $r + s = 24$ and $r - s = x$, we can solve for $r$ and $s$:\n$$\nr = \\frac{24 + x}{2}, \\quad s = \\frac{24 - x}{2}\n$$\nSo:\n$$\nrs = \\left(\\frac{24 + x}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{24 - x}{2}\\right) = \\frac{24^2 - x^2}{4}\n$$\nNow, we substitute into the expression for $r^2 + s^2$:\n$$\nr^2 + s^2 = 576 - 2rs = 576 - 2 \\cdot \\frac{24^2 - x^2}{4}\n$$\n$$\nr^2 + s^2 = 576 - \\frac{24^2 - x^2}{2}\n$$\n$$\nr^2 + s^2 = 576 - \\frac{576 - x^2}{2}\n$$\n$$\nr^2 + s^2 = 576 - 288 + \\frac{x^2}{2}\n$$\n$$\nr^2 + s^2 = 288 + \\frac{x^2}{2}\n$$\nNow, we need to find $x^2$. From the equation for $a^2$:\n$$\na^2 = \\frac{(r - s)^2}{4} + 36 = \\frac{x^2}{4} + 36\n$$\nBut we also know that the area of the trapezoid is 72, and the height is 6. The area can be written as:\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{(r + s)}{2} \\cdot h = \\frac{24}{2} \\cdot 6 = 72\n$$\nThis confirms that all the values are consistent. However, we need to find $x^2$. From the equation for $a^2$, we know:\n$$\na^2 = \\frac{x^2}{4} + 36\n$$\nBut we also know that $a$ is the length of the non-parallel side. Since the trapezoid has an inscribed circle, the length of the non-parallel side $a$ is equal to the diameter of the circle. The diameter is 6, so:\n$$\na = 6\n$$\nSo, substituting $a = 6$ into the equation for $a^2$:\n$$\n6^2 = \\frac{x^2}{4} + 36\n$$\n$$\n36 = \\frac{x^2}{4} + 36\n$$\n$$\n0 = \\frac{x^2}{4}\n$$\n$$\nx^2 = 0\n$$\nSo, $x = 0$, which means $r = s$.

Then he draws 25 more line segments through the disk, each segment being defined by selecting two points at random on the perimeter of the disk in different quadrants and connecting those two points. We are to find the expected number of regions into which these 27 line segments divide the disk.\n\nTo solve this, we need to understand how line segments (chords) divide a disk into regions. The key insight is that each new line segment can intersect existing line segments, and each intersection increases the number of regions.\n\nFor a circle with $ n $ chords, the expected number of regions $ R $ is given by the formula:\n\n$$\nR = 1 + n + \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}\n$$\n\nThis formula is derived from the fact that each new chord can intersect all the previous chords, and each intersection increases the number of regions.\n\nIn this problem, there are 27 line segments.

This is a modular counting problem that can be tackled using generating functions or combinatorial counting modulo $3^7$.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the possible values of $a^3 \\mod 3^7$ for $a \\in [1, 3^6]$.\n\nWe note that for any integer $x$, $x^3 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3^7$ if and only if $x \\equiv 0 \\mod 3^7$. However, we are only considering $x \\leq 3^6$, so the only value of $x$ such that $x^3 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3^7$ is $x = 0$, but $x$ must be at least 1, so $x^3 \\mod 3^7 \\neq 0$ for all $x \\in [1, 3^6]$.\n\nThus, each $a^3, b^3, c^3 \\mod 3^7$ is non-zero. This observation will help us simplify the problem.\n\nWe can now consider the number of possible values of $x^3 \\mod 3^7$ for $x \\in [1, 3^6]$.

Then, the number of distinct values of $f(x)$ is equal to the number of distinct values of $x^3 \\mod 3^7$ for $x \\in [1, 3^6]$.\n\nWe can compute this using the fact that $x^3 \\mod 3^7$ is periodic with period $3^7$, and since $x \\leq 3^6$, we can compute the number of distinct values of $x^3 \\mod 3^7$ directly.\n\nLet\u2019s compute the number of distinct values of $x^3 \\mod 3^7$ for $x \\in [1, 3^6]$.\n\nWe can note that for $x \\in [1, 3^6]$, the value of $x^3 \\mod 3^7$ is unique for each $x$, because $x^3 \\mod 3^7$ is a strictly increasing function modulo $3^7$. So, the number of distinct values is exactly $3^6$.\n\nHence, there are $3^6 = 729$ distinct values of $x^3 \\mod 3^7$ for $x \\in [1, 3^6]$.\n\nNow, we want to count the number of triples $(a, b, c)$ such that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3^7$.

That is, the center of $\\omega_2$ is at a distance of $15 - 6 = 9$ from $A$.\n- Let\u2019s place the center of $\\omega_2$ at point $O = (9, 0)$, so that the point of tangency $B$ lies on the line connecting $A$ and $O$, and since $B$ is on $\\omega_1$, it is at a distance of 6 from $A$, so $B = (6, 0)$.\n\nNow, since $\\overline{BC}$ is a diameter of $\\omega_2$, and $\\omega_2$ has center $O = (9, 0)$ and radius 15, the diameter $\\overline{BC}$ is a line segment of length 30 that passes through $O$, and since $C$ lies on $\\omega_2$, it must be located symmetrically with respect to $O$.\n\nSince $B = (6, 0)$, and $\\overline{BC}$ is a diameter of $\\omega_2$, then $C$ is the point diametrically opposite to $B$ on $\\omega_2$. The vector from $O$ to $B$ is $(-3, 0)$, so the vector from $O$ to $C$ is $(3, 0)$. So, $C = O + (3, 0) = (12, 0)$.\n\nNow, since $\\overline{BC} \\perp \\overline{AD}$, and $\\overline{BC}$ is the horizontal segment from $B = (6, 0)$ to $C = (12, 0)$, the line $\\overline{BC}$ is horizontal. Therefore, $\\overline{AD}$ must be vertical, i.e., it is perpendicular to $\\overline{BC}$, so $\\overline{AD}$ is a vertical line through point $A = (0, 0)$, so it is the vertical line $x = 0$.\n\nNow, we are told that rectangle $EFGH$ is inscribed in $\\omega_1$, with $\\overline{EF} \\perp \\overline{BC}$, which is horizontal, so $\\overline{EF}$ must be vertical. Therefore, the rectangle has vertical sides $\\overline{EF}$ and $\\overline{GH}$, and horizontal sides $\\overline{FG}$ and $\\overline{EH}$.\n\nSince $\\overline{EF} \\perp \\overline{BC}$, and $\\overline{BC}$ is horizontal, the vertical line $\\overline{EF}$ must be vertical. So, the rectangle is aligned such that its vertical sides are vertical, and its horizontal sides are horizontal.\n\nNow, the rectangle is inscribed in $\\omega_1$, which has center at $A = (0, 0)$ and radius 6. So the rectangle must be entirely inside $\\omega_1$, with its sides touching the circle.\n\nWe are also told that $C$ is closer to $\\overline{GH}$ than to $\\overline{EF}$, and $D$ is closer to $\\overline{FG}$ than to $\\overline{EH}$.\n\nWe are told that the areas of triangles $\\triangle DGF$ and $\\triangle CHG$ are equal. This gives us a condition that can help us find the dimensions of the rectangle.\n\nLet\u2019s now define the coordinates of the rectangle, assuming that $\\overline{EF}$ is vertical and $\\overline{GH}$ is the opposite vertical side, and $\\overline{FG}$ and $\\overline{EH}$ are horizontal sides.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the coordinates of the rectangle as follows:\n- $E = (x, y)$\n- $F = (x, y + h)$\n- $G = (x + w, y + h)$\n- $H = (x + w, y)$\n\nWhere:\n- $w$ is the width of the rectangle\n- $h$ is the height of the rectangle\n- $x$ is the horizontal coordinate of the bottom-left corner of the rectangle\n\nGiven that the rectangle is inscribed in $\\omega_1$, the top-right corner $G = (x + w, y + h)$ lies on the circle $\\omega_1$, so:\n\n$$\n(x + w)^2 + (y + h)^2 = 6^2 = 36\n$$\n\nAlso, the bottom-left corner $E = (x, y)$ lies on the circle, so:\n\n$$\nx^2 + y^2 = 36\n$$\n\nNow, since $\\overline{EF} \\perp \\overline{BC}$, and $\\overline{BC}$ is horizontal, this condition is already satisfied.\n\nNow we are told that $C = (12, 0)$, and $D$ is a point on $\\omega_2$ such that $\\overline{BC} \\perp \\overline{AD}$, and $\\overline{AD}$ is vertical, so $D$ lies on the vertical line $x = 0$.\n\nLet\u2019s find the coordinates of point $D$ on $\\omega_2$ that lies on the vertical line $x = 0$. Since $\\omega_2$ is centered at $O = (9, 0)$ with radius 15, the point $D$ on the vertical line $x = 0$ must satisfy:\n\n$$\n(0 - 9)^2 + (y - 0)^2 = 15^2 \\Rightarrow 81 + y^2 = 225 \\Rightarrow y^2 = 144 \\Rightarrow y = \\pm 12\n$$\n\nSo, point $D$ can be either $(0, 12)$ or $(0, -12)$. Since $C$ is at $(12, 0)$, and $D$ is closer to $\\overline{FG}$ than to $\\overline{EH}$, and we are to assume a specific orientation (e.g., $D = (0, 12)$), we'll take $D = (0, 12)$ for simplicity.\n\nNow, we are told that the areas of triangles $\\triangle DGF$ and $\\triangle CHG$ are equal.\n\nLet\u2019s find the coordinates of the points involved:\n- $D = (0, 12)$\n- $G = (x + w, y + h)$\n- $F = (x, y + h)$\n- $H = (x + w, y)$\n\nWe can now compute the area of $\\triangle DGF$ and $\\triangle CHG$ using the formula for the area of a triangle given coordinates:\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|\n$$\n\nLet\u2019s compute the area of $\\triangle DGF$:\n- $D = (0, 12)$\n- $G = (x + w, y + h)$\n- $F = (x, y + h)$\n\n$$\n\\text{Area}_{DGF} = \\frac{1}{2} |0(y + h - (y + h)) + x((y + h) - 12) + (x + w)(12 - (y + h))|\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} |0 + x(y + h - 12) + (x + w)(12 - y - h)|\n$$\n\nNow, compute the area of $\\triangle CHG$:\n- $C = (12, 0)$\n- $H = (x + w, y)$\n- $G = (x + w, y + h)$\n\n$$\n\\text{Area}_{CHG} = \\frac{1}{2} |12(y - (y + h)) + (x + w)((y + h) - y) + (x + w)(y - 0)|\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} |12(-h) + (x + w)(h) + (x + w)y|\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} |-12h + (x + w)h + (x + w)y|\n$$\n\nWe are told that the two areas are equal, so:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} |x(y + h - 12) + (x + w)(12 - y - h)| = \\frac{1}{2} |-12h + (x + w)h + (x + w)y|\n$$\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n$$\n|x(y + h - 12) + (x + w)(12 - y - h)| = |-12h + (x + w)h + (x + w)y|\n$$\n\nLet\u2019s simplify both sides.\n\nLeft side:\n$$\n|x(y + h - 12) + (x + w)(12 - y - h)|\n$$\n\nRight side:\n$$\n|-12h + (x + w"

For a 24-gon, the number of such pairings is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{12} \\times 24 = 2\n$$\nThis is because each pairing is counted 12 times (once for each vertex in the pair), and there are 24 vertices.\n\nThe answer is the number of such pairings, which is $\\boxed{2}$."
