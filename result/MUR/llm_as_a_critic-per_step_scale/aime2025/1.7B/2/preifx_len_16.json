The area of triangle $ ABC $ is $ \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AB \\cdot h = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 28 \\cdot h = 14h $.\n\nNow we determine the coordinates of all the points:\n\n- $ A = (0, 0) $\n- $ D = (4, 0) $ (since $ AD = 4 $)\n- $ E = (4 + 16, 0) = (20, 0) $ (since $ DE = 16 $)\n- $ B = (28, 0) $ (since $ EB = 8 $)\n- $ F = (13, 0) $ (since $ AF = 13 $)\n- $ G = (13 + 52, 0) = (65, 0) $ (since $ FG = 52 $)\n- $ C = (0, h) $ (since $ GC = 26 $)\n\nNow, we can find the coordinates of $ M $ and $ N $, the reflections of $ D $ through $ F $ and $ G $ through $ E $, respectively.\n\n- $ M $ is the reflection of $ D = (4, 0) $ through $ F = (13, 0) $. Since $ F $ is the midpoint between $ D $ and $ M $, we can find $ M $ as follows:\n  $$\n  M = (2 \\cdot 13 - 4, 0) = (22, 0)\n  $$\n- $ N $ is the reflection of $ G = (65, 0) $ through $ E = (20, 0) $. Similarly, $ N = (2 \\cdot 20 - 65, 0) = (40 - 65, 0) = (-25, 0) $\n\nNow we have the coordinates of all points:\n\n- $ A = (0, 0) $\n- $ F = (13, 0) $\n- $ N = (-25, 0) $\n- $ B = (28, 0) $\n- $ C = (0, h) $\n- $ E = (20, 0) $\n- $ G = (65, 0) $\n- $ M = (22, 0) $\n\nWe are given that the area of quadrilateral $ DEGF $ is 288. Let's compute the area of quadrilateral $ DEGF $ using the coordinates of its vertices:\n\n- $ D = (4, 0) $\n- $ E = (20, 0) $\n- $ G = (65, 0) $\n- $ F = (13, 0) $\n\nWe can compute the area of quadrilateral $ DEGF $ using the shoelace formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_4 + x_4y_1 - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + y_3x_4 + y_4x_1) \\right|\n$$\n\nSubstitute the coordinates:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 4 \\cdot 0 + 20 \\cdot 0 + 65 \\cdot 0 + 13 \\cdot 0 - (0 \\cdot 20 + 0 \\cdot 65 + 0 \\cdot 13 + 0 \\cdot 4) \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0 - 0 \\right| = 0\n$$\n\nThis is not correct. It seems that the points $ D, E, G, F $ are colinear. But this contradicts the given area. This suggests an error in the setup.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the area of quadrilateral $ DEGF $ is 288, so we must have a non-zero area. This implies that the points are not colinear, and the earlier assumption that all points lie on the x-axis is incorrect. Therefore, we need to reconsider the coordinate system.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that triangle $ ABC $ is not necessarily a right triangle. Let\u2019s place point $ A $ at $ (0, 0) $, point $ B $ at $ (28, 0) $, and point $ C $ at $ (0, h) $, as before. Then the area of triangle $ ABC $ is $ \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 28 \\cdot h = 14h $.\n\nNow, we can determine the coordinates of the points:\n\n- $ D = (4, 0) $\n- $ E = (20, 0) $\n- $ G = (65, 0) $\n- $ F = (13, 0) $\n\nThe area of quadrilateral $ DEGF $ is given as 288. Since $ D, E, G, F $ are all on the x-axis, the area of this quadrilateral is zero, which is not possible. Therefore, the points are not on the x-axis, and the triangle $ ABC $ is not a right triangle. So we need to reconsider the coordinate system.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that triangle $ ABC $ is not a right triangle, and place point $ A = (0, 0) $, point $ B = (28, 0) $, and point $ C = (x, y) $, with $ x $ and $ y $ being unknowns.\n\nNow, we can calculate the area of quadrilateral $ DEGF $ using the shoelace formula with the coordinates of $ D, E, G, F $, and set it equal to 288.\n\nLet\u2019s define the coordinates of the points:\n\n- $ D = (4, 0) $\n- $ E = (20, 0) $\n- $ G = (65, 0) $\n- $ F = (13, 0) $\n\nThe area of quadrilateral $ DEGF $ is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_4 + x_4y_1 - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + y_3x_4 + y_4x_1) \\right|\n$$\n\nSubstituting the coordinates:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 4 \\cdot 0 + 20 \\cdot 0 + 65 \\cdot 0 + 13 \\cdot 0 - (0 \\cdot 20 + 0 \\cdot 65 + 0 \\cdot 13 + 0 \\cdot 4) \\right| = 0\n$$\n\nThis is not possible. Therefore, the points are not colinear, and the triangle $ ABC $ is not a right triangle. Therefore, the earlier assumption that all points lie on the x-axis is incorrect.\n\nLet\u2019s assume a different coordinate system where points $ D, E, G, F $ are not on the x-axis, and triangle $ ABC $ is not a right triangle. Then we can compute the area of quadrilateral $ DEGF $ and use it to find the height $ h $ of triangle $ ABC $.\n\nLet\u2019s define the coordinates of the points:\n\n- $ A = (0, 0) $\n- $ B = (28, 0) $\n- $ C = (0, h) $\n- $ D = (4, 0) $\n- $ E = (20, 0) $\n- $ G = (65, 0) $\n- $ F = (13, 0) $\n\nLet\u2019s define the coordinates of the points $ D, E, G, F $ in a different way, not on the x-axis. Let\u2019s assume that $ D = (4, y_1) $, $ E = (20, y_2) $, $ G = (65, y_3) $, $ F = (13, y_4) $, and calculate the area of quadrilateral $ DEGF $ using the shoelace formula.\n\nLet\u2019s define the coordinates of the points:\n\n- $ D = (4, y_1) $\n- $ E = (20, y_2) $\n- $ G = (65, y_3) $\n- $ F = (13, y_4) $\n\nNow, we can compute the area of quadrilateral $ DEGF $ using the shoelace formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left|"

We are to find the area of triangle $ \\triangle BGE $.\n\nLet\u2019s assign coordinates to the points on the line. Let $ A $ be at coordinate 0. Then $ B $ is at coordinate $ x $, $ C $ is at $ x + 26 $, $ D $ is at $ x + 26 + 22 = x + 48 $, $ E $ is at $ x + 48 + 31 = x + 79 $, and $ F $ is at $ x + 79 + 33 = x + 112 $. Since $ AF = 73 $, we have:\n\n$$\nF - A = x + 112 - 0 = x + 112 = 73 \\Rightarrow x = 73 - 112 = -39\n$$\n\nSo the coordinates of the points on the line are:\n- $ A = 0 $\n- $ B = -39 $\n- $ C = 26 $\n- $ D = 48 $\n- $ E = 79 $\n- $ F = 112 $\n\nNow, we are given $ CG = 40 $ and $ DG = 30 $. Let\u2019s find the coordinates of $ G $. Let $ G = (g_x, g_y) $.\n\nFrom the coordinates of $ C = (26, 0) $ and $ D = (48, 0) $, we can find the coordinates of $ G $ using the distances $ CG = 40 $ and $ DG = 30 $. Since both $ C $ and $ D $ are on the x-axis, the y-coordinate of $ G $ must be 0 (as $ G $ is not on the line). So $ G = (g_x, 0) $.\n\nWe now have two equations from the distances:\n- $ CG = 40 \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{(g_x - 26)^2 + 0^2} = 40 \\Rightarrow |g_x - 26| = 40 \\Rightarrow g_x = 26 + 40 = 66 $ or $ g_x = 26 - 40 = -14 $\n- $ DG = 30 \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{(g_x - 48)^2 + 0^2} = 30 \\Rightarrow |g_x - 48| = 30 \\Rightarrow g_x = 48 + 30 = 78 $ or $ g_x = 48 - 30 = 18 $\n\nSo we have two possible values for $ g_x $: 66, -14, 78, or 18. We must find which one satisfies both distance conditions.\n\nLet\u2019s test $ g_x = 66 $:\n- $ |66 - 26| = 40 $ (OK)\n- $ |66 - 48| = 18 $ (Not 30) \u2192 Not valid\n\nLet\u2019s test $ g_x = -14 $:\n- $ |-14 - 26| = 40 $ (OK)\n- $ |-14 - 48| = 62 $ (Not 30) \u2192 Not valid\n\nLet\u2019s test $ g_x = 78 $:\n- $ |78 - 26| = 52 $ (Not 40) \u2192 Not valid\n\nLet\u2019s test $ g_x = 18 $:\n- $ |18 - 26| = 8 $ (Not 40) \u2192 Not valid\n\nSo the only valid value is $ g_x = 66 $, but this gives $ |66 - 48| = 18 $, which is not 30. So this is a contradiction.\n\nThis suggests a miscalculation or misinterpretation. Let\u2019s re-express the problem using coordinate geometry and solve for the coordinates of $ G $.\n\nLet\u2019s assume $ G = (g_x, g_y) $.

We are given the distances $ AC = 26 $, $ BD = 22 $, $ CE = 31 $, $ DF = 33 $, $ AF = 73 $, $ CG = 40 $, and $ DG = 30 $. We are to find the area of triangle $ \\triangle BGE $.\n\nLet\u2019s assign coordinates to the points on the line. Let $ A $ be at coordinate 0. Then $ B $ is at coordinate $ x $, $ C $ is at $ x + 26 $, $ D $ is at $ x + 26 + 22 = x + 48 $, $ E $ is at $ x + 48 + 31 = x + 79 $, and $ F $ is at $ x + 79 + 33 = x + 112 $. Since $ AF = 73 $, we have:\n\n$$\nF - A = x + 112 - 0 = x + 112 = 73 \\Rightarrow x = 73 - 112 = -39\n$$\n\nSo the coordinates of the points on the line are:\n- $ A = 0 $\n- $ B = -39 $\n- $ C = 26 $\n- $ D = 48 $\n- $ E = 79 $\n- $ F = 112 $\n\nNow, we are given $ CG = 40 $ and $ DG = 30 $. Let\u2019s find the coordinates of $ G $. Let $ G = (g_x, g_y) $.\n\nFrom the coordinates of $ C = (26, 0) $ and $ D = (48, 0) $, we can find the coordinates of $ G $ using the distances $ CG = 40 $ and $ DG = 30 $. Since both $ C $ and $ D $ are on the x-axis, the y-coordinate of $ G $ must be 0 (as $ G $ is not on the line). So $ G = (g_x, 0) $.\n\nWe now have two equations from the distances:\n- $ CG = 40 \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{(g_x - 26)^2 + 0^2} = 40 \\Rightarrow |g_x - 26| = 40 \\Rightarrow g_x = 26 + 40 = 66 $ or $ g_x = 26 - 40 = -14 $\n- $ DG = 30 \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{(g_x - 48)^2 + 0^2} = 30 \\Rightarrow |g_x - 48| = 30 \\Rightarrow g_x = 48 + 30 = 78 $ or $ g_x = 48 - 30 = 18 $\n\nSo we have two possible values for $ g_x $: 66, -14, 78, or 18. We must find which one satisfies both distance conditions.\n\nLet\u2019s test $ g_x = 66 $:\n- $ |66 - 26| = 40 $ (OK)\n- $ |66 - 48| = 18 $ (Not 30) \u2192 Not valid\n\nLet\u2019s test $ g_x = -14 $:\n- $ |-14 - 26| = 40 $ (OK)\n- $ |-14 - 48| = 62 $ (Not 30) \u2192 Not valid\n\nLet\u2019s test $ g_x = 78 $:\n- $ |78 - 26| = 52 $ (Not 40) \u2192 Not valid\n\nLet\u2019s test $ g_x = 18 $:\n- $ |18 - 26| = 8 $ (Not 40) \u2192 Not valid\n\nSo the only valid value is $ g_x = 66 $, but this gives $ |66 - 48| = 18 $, which is not 30. So this is a contradiction.\n\nThis suggests a miscalculation or misinterpretation. Let\u2019s re-express the problem using coordinate geometry and solve for the coordinates of $ G $.\n\nLet\u2019s assume $ G = (g_x, g_y) $.

So the rectangle is aligned with the x-axis and y-axis.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the rectangle has width $w$ and height $h$, with $EF = w$ and $GH = h$.\n\nLet\u2019s define the rectangle's coordinates:\n- $E = (x, y)$\n- $F = (x + w, y)$\n- $G = (x + w, y + h)$\n- $H = (x, y + h)$\n\nWe are told that $C = (45, 0)$ is closer to $\\overline{GH}$ than to $\\overline{EF}$, and $D = (0, y_D)$ is closer to $\\overline{FG}$ than to $\\overline{EH}$.\n\nSince $\\overline{GH}$ is the segment from $(x + w, y + h)$ to $(x, y + h)$, and $\\overline{EF}$ is from $(x, y)$ to $(x + w, y)$, the vertical distance between them is $h$. So $C = (45, 0)$ is closer to $\\overline{GH}$, meaning it is closer to the top of the rectangle than to the bottom. So $C$ is above the rectangle, and the rectangle must be below $C$.\n\nSince $C = (45, 0)$, and the rectangle is below it, so the rectangle's top side is at $y + h$. So we must have $y + h \\geq 0$, and the rectangle is below $C$, so $y + h \\leq 0$.\n\nSo the rectangle is below the x-axis, and the top of the rectangle is at $y + h$, which is below $C = (45, 0)$. So $y + h < 0$.\n\nNow, $D = (0, y_D)$ is closer to $\\overline{FG}$ than to $\\overline{EH}$.\n\n$\\overline{FG}$ is the segment from $(x + w, y)$ to $(x + w, y + h)$, and $\\overline{EH}$ is the segment from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + h)$. So the vertical distance between them is $h$.\n\nSo $D = (0, y_D)$ is closer to $\\overline{FG}$ than to $\\overline{EH}$, meaning $y_D$ is closer to the top of the rectangle than to the bottom. So $y_D$ is closer to $y + h$ than to $y$.\n\nSo the vertical distance from $D$ to $\\overline{FG}$ is $|y_D - (y + h)|$ and to $\\overline{EH}$ is $|y_D - y|$. So we are told that $|y_D - (y + h)| < |y_D - y|$.\n\nThis gives us:\n$$\n|y_D - (y + h)| < |y_D - y|\n$$\n\nSquaring both sides:\n$$\n(y_D - y - h)^2 < (y_D - y)^2\n$$\n\nExpanding:\n$$\n(y_D - y - h)^2 = (y_D - y)^2 - 2(y_D - y)h + h^2\n$$\n\nSo:\n$$\n(y_D - y)^2 - 2h(y_D - y) + h^2 < (y_D - y)^2\n$$\n\nSubtracting $(y_D - y)^2$ from both sides:\n$$\n-2h(y_D - y) + h^2 < 0\n$$\n\nFactor $h$:\n$$\nh(-2(y_D - y) + h) < 0\n$$\n\nSince $h > 0$, this implies:\n$$\n-2(y_D - y) + h < 0 \\Rightarrow h < 2(y_D - y)\n$$\n\n---"

That is, all divisors except 2025 itself.\n- Let $ E $ be the number of elements in $ A $ that have $ 3^4 $ and $ 5^4 $, i.e., exactly $ 2025 $.\n\nThen, the number of subsets of $ A $ with LCM 2025 is:\n\n$$\n|C| = 2^{24} - 1\n$$\n\nWhere $ 2^{24} $ is the total number of subsets of $ A $, and we subtract 1 to remove the empty set.\n\nBut we must also ensure that the subset contains at least one element that has $ 3^4 $ and at least one that has $ 5^4 $. So we need to use inclusion-exclusion.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- $ S $: the set of all subsets of $ A $ with LCM 2025.\n- $ A_1 $: subsets that do **not** contain any element with $ 3^4 $.\n- $ A_2 $: subsets that do **not** contain any element with $ 5^4 $.\n- $ A_3 $: subsets that do **not** contain $ 2025 $.\n\nWe want the number of subsets that do **not** belong to $ A_1 $ or $ A_2 $, and do **not** belong to $ A_3 $.\n\nBy inclusion-exclusion:\n\n$$\n|C| = 2^{25} - 2 \\cdot 2^{24} + 2^{24} - 1\n$$\n\nLet\u2019s simplify:\n\n$$\n|C| = 2^{25} - 2 \\cdot 2^{24} + 2^{24} - 1 = 2^{25} - 2^{24} - 1\n$$\n\nTherefore, the number of subsets $ B $ with LCM 2025 is:\n\n$$\n|C| = 2^{25} - 2^{24} - 1\n$$\n\nWe are to find the probability that $ B $ is a nonempty subset with LCM 2025. This is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{|C|}{2^{25}} = \\frac{2^{25} - 2^{24} - 1}{2^{25}} = 1 - \\frac{2^{24} + 1}{2^{25}} = 1 - \\frac{2 + \\frac{1}{2^{24}}}{2}\n$$\n\nNow, note that $ 2^{24} $ is a very large number, so $ \\frac{1}{2^{24}} $ is negligible, and we can approximate:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2^{24} + 1}{2^{25}} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2^{24}}\n$$\n\nSo the probability is approximately:\n\n$$\n1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2^{24}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2^{24}}\n$$\n\nBut since the problem asks for the probability in the form $ \\frac{m}{n} $, we need to find the exact value.\n\nLet\u2019s compute:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2^{25} - 2^{24} - 1}{2^{25}} = \\frac{2^{24}(2 - 1) - 1}{2^{25}} = \\frac{2^{24} - 1}{2^{25}} = \\frac{2^{24} - 1}{2^{25}}\n$$\n\nNow, we simplify $ \\frac{2^{24} - 1}{2^{25}} $:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2^{24} - 1}{2^{25}} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2^{24}} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2^{24}}\n$$\n\nThis is in the form $ \\frac{m}{n} $, where $ m = 2^{24} - 1 $ and $ n = 2^{25} $. We simplify:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2^{24} - 1}{2^{25}} = \\frac{2^{24} - 1}{2^{25}} = \\frac{2^{24} - 1}{2 \\cdot 2^{24}} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2^{24}}\n$$\n\nSo the simplified form is $ \\frac{2^{24} - 1}{2^{25}} $, and since $ 2^{24} - 1 $ and $ 2^{25} $ are relatively prime (since $ 2^{24} - 1 $ is odd and $ 2^{25} $ is even), the fraction is in lowest terms.\n\nThus, the probability is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2^{24} - 1}{2^{25}}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{2^{24} - 1}\n$$\n\nthe answer is $\\boxed{2^{24} - 1}$"

So we must have $ b = 0 $, which implies $ K = (a, 0) $, and $ L = (0, a) $.\n\nNow check $ KL = 14 $:\n\n$$\nKL^2 = (0 - a)^2 + (a - 0)^2 = 2a^2 = 196 \\Rightarrow a^2 = 98 \\Rightarrow a = \\sqrt{98} = 7\\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n- $ K = (7\\sqrt{2}, 0) $\n- $ L = (0, 7\\sqrt{2}) $\n\nNow, we can find the coordinates of $ B $ and $ C $.\n\nLet\u2019s recall $ BC = 38 $, and $ B = (b, 0) $, $ C = (0, c) $, so:\n\n$$\nBC^2 = b^2 + c^2 = 38^2 = 1444 \\tag{8}\n$$\n\nAlso, the triangle is right-angled at $ A $, so we don\u2019t have more constraints on $ b $ and $ c $.\n\nNow, we can find the area of quadrilateral $ BKLC $.\n\nQuadrilateral $ BKLC $ has vertices:\n\n- $ B = (b, 0) $\n- $ K = (7\\sqrt{2}, 0) $\n- $ L = (0, 7\\sqrt{2}) $\n- $ C = (0, c) $\n\nWe can use the shoelace formula to compute the area of quadrilateral $ BKLC $.\n\n---"
