We are to find $ r^2 + s^2 $, where $ r $ and $ s $ are the lengths of the parallel sides.\n\nFirst, the formula for the area of a trapezoid is:\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2}(r + s) \\cdot h\n$$\nwhere $ h $ is the height of the trapezoid.\n\nWe are told the area is 72 and the radius of the inscribed circle is 3. The radius of the inscribed circle is related to the height of the trapezoid by the formula:\n$$\nh = 2r\n$$\nSo, the height $ h = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6 $.\n\nNow, substitute the known values into the area formula:\n$$\n72 = \\frac{1}{2}(r + s) \\cdot 6\n$$\n$$\n72 = 3(r + s)\n$$\n$$\nr + s = 24\n$$\n\nWe are also told that the trapezoid is isosceles and has an inscribed circle. For a trapezoid to have an inscribed circle, the sum of the lengths of the two parallel sides must equal the sum of the lengths of the two non-parallel sides. In this case, the trapezoid is isosceles, so the non-parallel sides are equal in length.\n\nLet the lengths of the non-parallel sides be $ a $, and the lengths of the parallel sides be $ r $ and $ s $. Then:\n$$\nr + s = 2a\n$$\nFrom earlier, we found that $ r + s = 24 $, so:\n$$\n2a = 24 \\Rightarrow a = 12\n$$\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid in terms of the radius of the inscribed circle:\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2}(r + s) \\cdot h = \\frac{1}{2}(24) \\cdot 6 = 72\n$$\nThis confirms our earlier calculation is correct.\n\nWe are to find $ r^2 + s^2 $.

The area is also given by:\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2}(r + s) \\cdot h = \\frac{1}{2}(24) \\cdot 6 = 72\n$$\nThis is consistent with the given area.\n\nNow, let\u2019s use the formula for the area in terms of the radius of the inscribed circle. For an isosceles trapezoid with an inscribed circle, the area is also given by:\n$$\n\\text{Area} = r \\cdot (r + s)\n$$\nSubstitute the known values:\n$$\n72 = 3 \\cdot 24 = 72\n$$\nThis confirms the consistency of the given values.\n\nTo find $ r^2 + s^2 $, we need to find $ rs $, the product of the lengths of the two parallel sides. We can use the identity:\n$$\nr^2 + s^2 = (r + s)^2 - 2rs\n$$\nWe already know $ r + s = 24 $, so:\n$$\nr^2 + s^2 = 24^2 - 2rs = 576 - 2rs\n$$\n\nNow, we can find $ rs $ using the formula for the area of a trapezoid.
