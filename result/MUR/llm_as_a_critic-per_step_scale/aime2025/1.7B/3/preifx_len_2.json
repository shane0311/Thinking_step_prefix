So the triangle is degenerate (area = 0)\n\nThis is a contradiction. So, there must be a mistake in the setup.\n\nLet\u2019s reevaluate.\n\nWe are given:\n- $ AC = 26 $, $ BD = 22 $, $ CE = 31 $, $ DF = 33 $, $ AF = 73 $, $ CG = 40 $, and $ DG = 30 $\n\nWe have already determined the positions of $ A, B, C, D, E, F $ as:\n\n- $ A = 0 $\n- $ B = -39 $\n- $ C = -13 $\n- $ D = 35 $\n- $ E = 114 $\n- $ F = 147 $\n\nNow, we are told $ G $ is not on the line. So $ G $ is not on the x-axis.\n\nBut we also know:\n- $ CG = 40 $, and $ DG = 30 $\n\nSo, $ G $ is 40 units from $ C $ and 30 units from $ D $. We found earlier that $ G = 5 $, but that is on the x-axis, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, there must be a mistake in the assumption that $ G $ is on the x-axis.\n\nLet\u2019s assume $ G $ is not on the x-axis and re-calculate.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the coordinates of $ G $ as $ (g_x, g_y) $, and find $ g_y $ such that:\n\n$$\n|g_x - (-13)| = 40 \\Rightarrow |g_x + 13| = 40 \\Rightarrow g_x = 27 \\text{ or } g_x = -53\n$$\n\n$$\n|g_x - 35| = 30 \\Rightarrow g_x = 65 \\text{ or } g_x = 5\n$$\n\nSo, the only valid $ g_x $ that satisfies both conditions is $ g_x = 5 $, which gives $ G = (5, g_y) $\n\nNow, we need to find $ g_y $.\n\nLet\u2019s assume $ G = (5, y) $, and use the fact that $ G $ is not on the x-axis (so $ y \\ne 0 $).\n\nNow, we can use the area of triangle $ \\triangle BGE $ using the determinant formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|\n$$\n\nAssign:\n- $ B = (-39, 0) $\n- $ G = (5, y) $\n- $ E = (114, 0) $\n\nPlug into the formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |(-39)(y - 0) + 5(0 - 0) + 114(0 - y)|\n$$\n\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} | -39y + 0 + 114(-y) |\n$$\n\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} | -39y - 114y | = \\frac{1}{2} | -153y | = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 153 |y| = \\frac{153}{2} |y|\n$$\n\nNow, we need to find $ y $. But we are not given $ y $ directly.\n\nHowever, we are not told where $ G $ is in relation to the line, so we can\u2019t determine $ y $ directly. Therefore, we must assume that the triangle is not degenerate (i.e., $ y \\ne 0 $).\n\nBut the problem asks for the area of triangle $ \\triangle BGE $, and we are not given any more information about $ G $, so we must have made a mistake.\n\nLet\u2019s re-evaluate.\n\nWe were told that $ G $ is not on the line, and $ CG = 40 $, $ DG = 30 $. So $ G $ is not on the x-axis.\n\nWe were also told that $ AF = 73 $, which is consistent with our earlier calculation.\n\nBut we have not been given any more information about $ G $, so we cannot find its exact coordinates, and hence we cannot compute the area.\n\nTherefore, the problem is ill-posed.\n\nBut the problem says to \"Find the area of $ \\triangle BGE $\", implying that the area is uniquely determined.\n\nSo, we must have made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nLet\u2019s try a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s reassign the positions of the points on the line and re-calculate.\n\nLet\u2019s assume $ A = 0 $, $ B = x $, $ C = x + 26 $, $ D = x + 48"

Since $\\omega_2$ has center $O = (21, 0)$ and radius 15, point $C$ lies on the circle such that $O$ is the midpoint of $BC$, and $BC = 30$ (diameter).\n\nLet\u2019s find coordinates of point $C$:\n- Since $O = (21, 0)$, and $BC$ is a diameter, then $C = (21 + 15, 0) = (36, 0)$, or $C = (21 - 15, 0) = (6, 0)$.\n- But $B = (6, 0)$, so $C = (6 + 15, 0) = (21, 0)$, or $C = (6 - 15, 0) = (-9, 0)$.\n\nSince $C$ is on $\\omega_2$ and $BC$ is a diameter of $\\omega_2$, and $B = (6, 0)$, then point $C$ must be at $(-9, 0)$.\n\nNow we have:\n- $B = (6, 0)$\n- $C = (-9, 0)$\n- $O = (21, 0)$\n\nNow, we are given that $\\overline{BC} \\perp \\overline{AD}$. Since $\\overline{BC}$ is horizontal (from $(-9, 0)$ to $(6, 0)$), then $\\overline{AD}$ is vertical, so point $D$ lies somewhere on the vertical line through $A = (0, 0)$, i.e., the y-axis.\n\nLet\u2019s denote $D = (0, d)$ for some $d \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow, we are told that $D$ is closer to $\\overline{FG}$ than to $\\overline{EH}$, and $C$ is closer to $\\overline{GH}$ than to $\\overline{EF}$, and the rectangle $EFGH$ is inscribed in $\\omega_1$.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the rectangle $EFGH$ is aligned with the coordinate axes, with $\\overline{EF} \\perp \\overline{BC}$, so $\\overline{EF}$ is vertical, and $\\overline{BC}$ is horizontal.\n\nLet\u2019s assume:\n- $E = (x, y)$\n- $F = (x, y + w)$\n- $G = (x + l, y + w)$\n- $H = (x + l, y)$\n\nThis is a rectangle with vertical side $EF$ of length $w$, and horizontal side $GH$ of length $l$.\n\nNow, since $EFGH$ is inscribed in $\\omega_1$, the center of $\\omega_1$ is at $A = (0, 0)$, and the rectangle is inscribed in $\\omega_1$, so the diagonals of the rectangle must pass through the center of the circle.\n\nThe diagonals of the rectangle are:\n- From $E = (x, y)$ to $G = (x + l, y + w)$\n- From $F = (x, y + w)$ to $H = (x + l, y)$\n\nThe midpoint of each diagonal is:\n- From $E$ to $G$: $\\left(x + \\frac{l}{2}, y + \\frac{w}{2}\\right)$\n- From $F$ to $H$: $\\left(x + \\frac{l}{2}, y + \\frac{w}{2}\\right)$\n\nSince the center of $\\omega_1$ is at $(0, 0)$, the midpoint of each diagonal must be the center of the circle. So:\n$$\nx + \\frac{l}{2} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y + \\frac{w}{2} = 0\n$$\n\nFrom this, we get:\n- $x = -\\frac{l}{2}$\n- $y = -\\frac{w}{2}$\n\nSo the rectangle has:\n- $E = \\left(-\\frac{l}{2}, -\\frac{w}{2}\\right)$\n- $F = \\left(-\\frac{l}{2}, 0\\right)$\n- $G = \\left(0, 0\\right)$\n- $H = \\left(0, -\\frac{w}{2}\\right)$\n\nNow, the rectangle is inscribed in $\\omega_1$, so the distance from the center of the circle to any vertex must be equal to the radius of the circle, which is 6.\n\nSo, the distance from $A = (0, 0)$ to $E = \\left(-\\frac{l}{2}, -\\frac{w}{2}\\right)$ is:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{l}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{w}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{l^2}{4} + \\frac{w^2}{4}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{l^2 + w^2}\n$$\n\nSet this equal to 6:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{l^2 + w^2} = 6 \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{l^2 + w^2} = 12 \\Rightarrow l^2 + w^2 = 144\n$$\n\nThis is the key equation we'll use.\n\n---"

So, the subset must include at least one element divisible by 81 and at least one element divisible by 25.\n\nWe can use inclusion-exclusion to count the number of subsets of $ A' $ that contain at least one element divisible by 81 and at least one element divisible by 25.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- Let $ S $ be the set of divisors of 2025 that are divisible by 81.\n- Let $ T $ be the set of divisors of 2025 that are divisible by 25.\n\nWe need to count the number of subsets of $ A' $ that include at least one element from $ S $ and at least one element from $ T $.\n\nLet\u2019s count the number of subsets of $ A' $ that include at least one element from $ S $ and at least one element from $ T $.\n\nLet\u2019s first calculate the number of subsets of $ A' $ that include at least one element from $ S $:\n- $ |A'| = 14 $\n- $ |S| = 4 $ (since 81 = 3^4, and the divisors of 2025 divisible by 81 are: 81, 243, 729, 2187 (but 2187 > 2025, so only 81, 243, 729, and 2025 itself is excluded from $ A' $, so only 3 elements: 81, 243, 729)\n\nSo, the number of subsets of $ A' $ that include at least one element from $ S $ is:\n$$\n2^{14} - 2^{14 - 3} = 2^{14} - 2^{11} = 16384 - 2048 = 14336\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the number of subsets of $ A' $ that include at least one element from $ T $ (i.e., divisible by 25) is:\n- $ |T| = 3 $ (since 25, 125, 625 are the divisors of 2025 divisible by 25, and 2025 is excluded from $ A' $)\n- So, the number of subsets of $ A' $ that include at least one element from $ T $ is:\n$$\n2^{14} - 2^{14 - 3} = 16384 - 2048 = 14336\n$$\n\nNow, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of subsets that include at least one element from $ S $ and at least one element from $ T $:\n$$\n|S \\cap T| = |S| \\cdot |T| = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9\n$$\n\nSo, the number of subsets of $ A' $ that include at least one element from $ S $ and at least one element from $ T $ is:\n$$\n|S \\cap T| \\cdot 2^{14 - |S| - |T|} = 9 \\cdot 2^{14 - 3 - 3} = 9 \\cdot 2^{8} = 9 \\cdot 256 = 2304\n$$\n\nFinally, we add 1 for the subset containing only 2025 (which is nonempty), and we have:\n$$\n2304 + 1 = 2305\n$$\n\nSo, the total number of nonempty subsets of $ A $ with LCM equal to 2025 is:\n$$\n2305\n$$"

We can think of placing $ k $ chairs in the row of $ n $ chairs, with at least one chair between each selected chair.\n\nTo find the total number of subsets of 16 chairs where no two people sit next to each other, we need to consider all possible values of $ k $ (from 0 to 8, since we can't have more than 8 people without having two adjacent). For each $ k $, we calculate the number of valid subsets using the formula above and sum them all.\n\nLet\u2019s compute the total number of such subsets:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{8} \\binom{16 - k + 1}{k}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute each term:\n\n- $ k = 0 $: $ \\binom{17}{0} = 1 $\n- $ k = 1 $: $ \\binom{16}{1} = 16 $\n- $ k = 2 $: $ \\binom{15}{2} = 105 $\n- $ k = 3 $: $ \\binom{14}{3} = 364 $\n- $ k = 4 $: $ \\binom{13}{4} = 715 $\n- $ k = 5 $: $ \\binom{12}{5} = 792 $\n- $ k = 6 $: $ \\binom{11}{6} = 462 $\n- $ k = 7 $: $ \\binom{10}{7} = 120 $\n- $ k = 8 $: $ \\binom{9}{8} = 9 $\n\nNow, sum these values:\n\n$$\n1 + 16 + 105 + 364 + 715 + 792 + 462 + 120 + 9 = 2964\n$$\n\nNow, the problem asks for the remainder when this number is divided by 1000.\n\n$$\n2964 \\mod 1000 = 964\n$$\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{964}\n$$\n\nthe answer is 964"
