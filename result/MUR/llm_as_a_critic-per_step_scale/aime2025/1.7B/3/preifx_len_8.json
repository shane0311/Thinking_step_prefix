Then $F(x)^3$ is the generating function for the number of such triples.\n\nBut since we are working modulo $3^7$, we can compute the number of solutions as:\n\n$$\n\\text{Number of solutions} = \\frac{1}{3^7} \\cdot \\sum_{a, b, c} [a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3^7]\n$$\n\nThis is the total number of such triples.\n\nNow, the total number of triples is $3^{18}$, and the average number of solutions to $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3^7$ is $\\frac{1}{3^7} \\cdot 3^{18} = 3^{11}$.\n\nSo, the number of solutions is $3^{11}$.\n\nTherefore, the number of ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ is $3^{11}$.\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when $3^{11}$ is divided by 1000.\n\n---\n\n###"

We are given the distances between various points on the line and between point $ G $ and some of the points. Our goal is to find the area of triangle $ \\triangle BGE $.\n\nWe start by assigning coordinates to the points on the line. Let\u2019s set the coordinate system so that point $ A $ is at $ 0 $, and the line is the x-axis.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the coordinates of the points on the line as follows:\n- $ A = 0 $\n- $ B = x $\n- $ C = y $\n- $ D = z $\n- $ E = w $\n- $ F = v $\n\nWe are given the distances between these points:\n- $ AC = 26 $ \u21d2 $ y - 0 = 26 $ \u21d2 $ y = 26 $\n- $ BD = 22 $ \u21d2 $ z - x = 22 $\n- $ CE = 31 $ \u21d2 $ w - y = 31 $ \u21d2 $ w = y + 31 = 26 + 31 = 57 $\n- $ DF = 33 $ \u21d2 $ v - z = 33 $\n- $ AF = 73 $ \u21d2 $ v - 0 = 73 $ \u21d2 $ v = 73 $\n\nNow we can find the coordinates of the points:\n- $ A = 0 $\n- $ B = x $\n- $ C = 26 $\n- $ D = z = x + 22 $\n- $ E = 57 $\n- $ F = 73 $\n\nNow we are given the distances from point $ G $ to some of the points:\n- $ CG = 40 $ \u21d2 $ |w - z| = 40 $ \u21d2 $ |57 - z| = 40 $ \u21d2 $ z = 57 - 40 = 17 $ or $ z = 57 + 40 = 97 $\n- $ DG = 30 $ \u21d2 $ |v - z| = 30 $ \u21d2 $ |73 - z| = 30 $ \u21d2 $ z = 73 - 30 = 43 $ or $ z = 73 + 30 = 103 $\n\nNow we can solve for $ z $ that satisfies both conditions:\n- $ z = 17 $ and $ z = 43 $ are not consistent with both $ |57 - z| = 40 $ and $ |73 - z| = 30 $\n- $ z = 97 $ and $ z = 103 $ are also not consistent with both $ |57 - z| = 40 $ and $ |73 - z| = 30 $\n\nThis suggests a contradiction, but we can proceed by assuming $ z = 17 $ (as it is the only one consistent with $ |57 - z| = 40 $) and check the consistency of $ |73 - z| = 30 $:\n\n- $ |73 - 17| = 56 \u2260 30 $\n\nThis is not consistent.

The rectangle is inscribed such that one side is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{BC}$, which is a diameter of $\\omega_2$.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- $A$ as the center of $\\omega_1$.\n- $B$ as the point of tangency between $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$.\n- $\\overline{BC}$ is a diameter of $\\omega_2$, so the length of $\\overline{BC}$ is $2 \\times 15 = 30$.\n- $\\overline{AD}$ is perpendicular to $\\overline{BC}$, so $\\overline{AD}$ is a line from $A$ to $D$ that is perpendicular to $\\overline{BC}$.\n\nLet\u2019s place the coordinate system:\n- Let point $A$ be the origin $(0, 0)$.\n- Since $\\omega_1$ has radius 6, its center is at $A = (0, 0)$.\n- Let\u2019s assume $\\overline{BC}$ is horizontal for simplicity, with point $B$ at $(0, -15)$, and point $C$ at $(0, 15)$ (since $\\overline{BC}$ is a diameter of $\\omega_2$).\n- Then, $\\overline{AD}$ is vertical, since it is perpendicular to $\\overline{BC}$, so point $D$ lies on the vertical line through $A$, at some point $(x, y)$, and since $\\overline{AD}$ is a radius of $\\omega_2$, it must be at a distance of 15 from $B$.\n\nLet\u2019s find coordinates of $D$:\n- Since $\\overline{AD}$ is perpendicular to $\\overline{BC}$, and $AD$ is a radius of $\\omega_2$, then $\\overline{AD}$ is a line from $A = (0, 0)$ to point $D$ such that $AD = 15$ and $D$ lies on $\\overline{BC}$, which is the vertical line $x = 0$.\n- So point $D$ is at $(0, d)$, and since $AD = 15$, we have $d = \\pm 15$. But since $D$ is closer to $\\overline{GH}$ than to $\\overline{EF}$, and $\\overline{BC}$ is vertical, we assume $D = (0, 15)$, as that is the top of the circle.\n\nNow we can define the rectangle $EFGH$:\n- $\\overline{EF} \\perp \\overline{BC}$, so it is horizontal.\n- $C = (0, 15)$, $D = (0, 15)$, and the rectangle lies in the circle $\\omega_1$ with radius 6.\n\nLet\u2019s define the rectangle:\n- $\\overline{EF}$ is a horizontal line segment at some height $y$, and it is parallel to the horizontal axis.\n- The rectangle has length $l$ and height $h$, with $l = 2 \\times \\text{width}$, and $h = 2 \\times \\text{height}$, since it is a rectangle.\n- Since $EF$ is horizontal and $\\overline{EF} \\perp \\overline{BC}$, and $\\overline{BC}$ is vertical, the rectangle lies in the circle $\\omega_1$.\n\nWe are told that the rectangle is inscribed in $\\omega_1$, and that $EFGH$ has the property that:\n- $C$ is closer to $\\overline{GH}$ than to $\\overline{EF}$.\n- $D$ is closer to $\\overline{FG}$ than to $\\overline{EH}$.\n\nLet\u2019s define the rectangle in terms of coordinates:\n- Let $E = (x, y)$, $F = (x + l, y)$, $G = (x + l, y + h)$, and $H = (x, y + h)$.\n- Since $\\overline{EF} \\perp \\overline{BC}$, and $\\overline{BC}$ is vertical, $\\overline{EF}$ is horizontal.\n- $C = (0, 15)$, $D = (0, 15)$, and the rectangle lies in $\\omega_1$.\n\nSince the rectangle is inscribed in $\\omega_1$, the top side $\\overline{GH}$ must be tangent to $\\omega_1$, and the bottom side $\\overline{EF}$ must be tangent to $\\omega_1$.\n\nLet\u2019s find the height $h$ of the rectangle such that the top side $\\overline{GH}$ is tangent to $\\omega_1$.\n\nThe equation of circle $\\omega_1$ is:\n$$\nx^2 + y^2 = 6^2 = 36\n$$\n\nThe top side of the rectangle is at $y = y + h$, and since it is tangent to $\\omega_1$, the point $(0, y + h)$ lies on the circle, so:\n$$\n0^2 + (y + h)^2 = 36 \\Rightarrow y + h = \\pm 6\n$$\nSince $y + h$ must be positive (as the rectangle is above the center), we have:\n$$\ny + h = 6 \\Rightarrow h = 6 - y\n$$\n\nNow, the bottom side $\\overline{EF}$ is at $y = y$, and since it is tangent to $\\omega_1$, the point $(0, y)$ lies on the circle, so:\n$$\n0^2 + y^2 = 36 \\Rightarrow y = \\pm 6\n$$\nAgain, since the rectangle is above the center, we take $y = 6$, so:\n$$\nh = 6 - 6 = 0\n$$\n\nThis is a contradiction, as the height of the rectangle would be zero. So we must have made a mistake in our assumptions.\n\nLet\u2019s reconsider the geometry.\n\nLet\u2019s place the center of $\\omega_1$ at $A = (0, 0)$, and the circle $\\omega_1$ has radius 6. The circle $\\omega_2$ is internally tangent to $\\omega_1$ at point $B$, so the distance between the centers is $6 + 15 = 21$. Let\u2019s place the center of $\\omega_2$ at $B = (0, -15)$, and the center of $\\omega_1$ at $A = (0, 0)$. Then the point $C$ is the endpoint of the diameter $\\overline{BC}$, so it is at $(0, 15)$.\n\nNow, $\\overline{AD}$ is perpendicular to $\\overline{BC}$, so it is vertical. Since $D$ is on $\\omega_2$, it lies on the circle centered at $B = (0, -15)$ with radius 15. So the coordinates of $D$ satisfy:\n$$\n(x - 0)^2 + (y + 15)^2 = 15^2 = 225\n$$\n\nLet\u2019s assume $D = (0, 15)$, since that is the top of the circle. Then:\n$$\n(0 - 0)^2 + (15 + 15)^2 = 30^2 = 900 \\neq 225\n$$\n\nSo that\u2019s not possible. Let\u2019s instead assume $D = (x, y)$ is on $\\omega_2$ and lies on the vertical line through $A = (0, 0)$, so $x = 0$. Then we have:\n$$\n(0 - 0)^2 + (y + 15)^2 = 15^2 \\Rightarrow (y + 15)^2 = 225 \\Rightarrow y + 15 = \\pm 15 \\Rightarrow y = 0 \\text{ or } y = -30\n$$\n\nSo possible points for $D$ are $(0, 0)$ or $(0, -30)$. But $D$ must be on $\\omega_2$, and the rectangle is inscribed in $\\omega_1$, so we choose $D = (0, -30)$, since it is below the center.\n\nNow, the rectangle $EFGH$ is inscribed in $\\omega_1$, with $\\overline{EF} \\perp \\overline{BC}$, so it is horizontal.\n\nLet\u2019s define the rectangle in terms of coordinates:\n- $E = (x, y)$, $F = (x + l, y)$, $G = (x + l, y + h)$, $H = (x, y + h)$\n- $\\overline{EF} \\perp \\overline{BC}$, so $\\overline{EF}$ is horizontal.\n- $\\overline{GH}$ is the top side of the rectangle, and it lies at height $y + h$, so it is tangent to $\\omega_1$ at some point.\n- $\\overline{EF}$ is at height $y$, so it is tangent to $\\omega_1$ at some point.\n\nSince $\\overline{EF}$ is horizontal and tangent to $\\omega_1$, the point $(0, y)$ lies"

This gives us $ 15 $ possible values of $ k $.\n\nFor each $ k $, the equation becomes:\n\n$$\n\\sin(5x) = \\frac{k}{7}\n$$\n\nWe now need to find the number of $ x $ in $ (0, 2\\pi) $ for which $ \\sin(5x) = \\frac{k}{7} $.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the equation $ \\sin(5x) = c $, where $ c = \\frac{k}{7} $, for $ c \\in [-1, 1] $.\n\nThe equation $ \\sin(5x) = c $ has $ 2 $ solutions in each period of the sine function, i.e., in the interval $ (0, 2\\pi) $, there are $ 2 $ solutions for each period of $ \\sin(5x) $.\n\nThe function $ \\sin(5x) $ has a period of $ \\frac{2\\pi}{5} $. So, in the interval $ 0 < x < 2\\pi $, the number of periods is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2\\pi}{\\frac{2\\pi}{5}} = 5\n$$\n\nThus, in the interval $ 0 < x < 2\\pi $, the equation $ \\sin(5x) = c $ has $ 2 \\times 5 = 10 $ solutions for each $ c \\in [-1, 1] $.\n\nSo, for each $ k $, there are 10 solutions to $ \\sin(5x) = \\frac{k}{7} $.\n\nNow, since there are 15 values of $ k $, the total number of solutions $ n $ is:\n\n$$\nn = 15 \\times 10 = 150\n$$\n\nNext, we need to find the number of these $ n = 150 $ solutions where the graph of $ y = f(x) $ is tangent to the $ x $-axis.\n\nA function is tangent to the $ x $-axis at a point if its derivative is zero at that point.

A regular 24-gon has 24 vertices, and we are to draw 12 segments such that each vertex is an endpoint of exactly one segment. This means that the 12 segments must partition the 24 vertices into 12 pairs, where each pair is connected by a segment of equal length.\n\n2. In a regular 24-gon, the distance between two vertices depends on the number of edges between them along the perimeter. For example, the distance between adjacent vertices is 1 edge, between vertices with one vertex in between is 2 edges, and so on.\n\n3. In a regular polygon, the length of a segment connecting two vertices depends on the number of edges between them. So, for a regular 24-gon, the possible segment lengths (in terms of the number of edges between the two vertices) are from 1 to 12, since the maximum number of edges between two vertices is 12 (i.e., the diameter of the polygon).\n\n4. A segment of length $ k $ (in terms of edges) is equal in length to a segment of length $ 14 - k $, since the polygon is regular and the total number of edges is 24.\n\n5. For a segment to be of equal length, we need to ensure that for each such segment, both endpoints are at the same distance from each other. That is, for a segment of length $ k $, the endpoints must be $ k $ edges apart in terms of steps along the perimeter.\n\n6. The key is to find all possible ways to pair the 24 vertices into 12 pairs, such that each pair is at the same distance from each other (i.e., each pair has the same number of edges between their endpoints).\n\n---\n\n### Strategy:\n\nWe can think of the 24-gon as a circle with 24 points labeled $ 0, 1, 2, ..., 23 $, and the distance between two vertices $ i $ and $ j $ is the minimum of $ |i-j| $ and $ 24 - |i-j| $.\n\nWe need to find all sets of 12 pairs of vertices such that each pair has the same distance from each other.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding all possible ways to partition the 24 vertices into 12 pairs, where each pair is at the same distance from each other.\n\n---\n\n###"
